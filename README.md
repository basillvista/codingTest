Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Test that checks if main page is loading
- Tests for CustomerController
- Seeders
- Uses simple middleware isAdmin
- Uses Laratrust to authorize user
- Uses policy
